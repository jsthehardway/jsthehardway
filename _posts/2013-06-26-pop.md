## Function description

The last element of the array is removed from the array and returned. 
1.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the this value as the argument. 
2.  Let lenVal be the result of calling the \[\[Get]] internal method of O with argument "length". 
3.  Let len be ToUint32(lenVal). 
4.  If len is zero,  
  a.  Call the \[\[Put]] internal method of O with arguments "length", 0, and true. 
  b.  Return undefined. 
5.  Else, len > 0 
  a.  Let indx be ToString(lenâ€“1). 
  b.  Let element be the result of calling the \[\[Get]] internal method of O with argument indx. 
  c.  Call the \[\[Delete]] internal method of O with arguments indx and true. 
  d.  Call the \[\[Put]] internal method of O with arguments "length", indx, and true. 
  e.  Return element. 

__NOTE__
The pop function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its this value be an Array object. Therefore it 
can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method. Whether the pop function can be applied successfully to 
a host object is implementation-dependent.

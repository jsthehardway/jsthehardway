## Function description

The arguments are appended to the end of the array, in the order in which they appear. The new length of the 
array is returned as the result of the call. 
When the push method is called with zero or more arguments item1, item2, etc., the following steps are taken: 
1.  Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the this value as the argument. 
2.  Let lenVal be the result of calling the \[\[Get]] internal method of O with argument "length". 
3.  Let n be ToUint32(lenVal). 
4.  Let items be an internal List whose elements are, in left to right order, the arguments that were passed to this 
function invocation. 
5.  Repeat, while items is not empty 
  a.  Remove the first element from items and let E be the value of the element. 
  b.  Call the \[\[Put]] internal method of O with arguments ToString(n), E, and true. 
  c.  Increase n by 1. 
6.  Call the \[\[Put]] internal method of O with arguments "length", n, and true. 
7.  Return n. 

The length property of the push method is 1. 

__NOTE__  The push function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its this value be an Array object. Therefore 
it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method. Whether the push function can be applied successfully 
to a host object is implementation-dependent.
